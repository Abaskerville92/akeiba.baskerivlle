I conducted an analysis of bike usage patterns at Cyclistic to understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, crucial for boosting annual memberships. Over a year of data, I found that annual members typically take longer trips (averaging 30 minutes) and ride about 20 times a month, primarily during weekday rush hours for commuting. In contrast, casual riders average shorter trips (15 minutes) and ride only four times a month, mostly on weekends for recreational purposes. Members have predictable bike return locations near homes and workplaces, while casual users have more varied returns reflecting spontaneous rides. To convert casual riders into members, I recommend targeted promotions, tailored marketing campaigns, community engagement events, user feedback surveys, and enhanced email marketing. These insights will inform strategic decisions to foster greater engagement and drive membership growth.
